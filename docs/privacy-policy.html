  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">UrbanAid &mdash; Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

  <p>UrbanAid ("we", "our", or "the app") is a free mobile application that helps users find nearby public utilities such as water fountains, restrooms, shelters, and health centers. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>Location Data (When In Use only)</strong></p>
  <p>UrbanAid requests access to your device's location while the app is open to show nearby utilities and sort results by distance. Your location is never tracked in the background and is not stored on our servers.</p>

  <p><strong>Account Information (Optional)</strong></p>
  <p>If you choose to create an account, we collect a username, email address, and password. Account creation is entirely optional — all core features (map, search, filters) work without an account.</p>

  <p><strong>User-Generated Content (Optional)</strong></p>
  <p>If you add a utility location or leave a review, that content is stored on our servers and associated with your account.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect analytics or usage data beyond basic crash reports.</li>
    <li>We do not serve advertisements.</li>
    <li>We do not use third-party tracking or advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not track your location in the background.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> To display nearby public utilities and sort results by distance. Processed on-device only.</li>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> To authenticate you and associate your contributions (added locations, reviews) with your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> To identify and fix application errors via Firebase Crashlytics. Crash data is anonymized and contains no personally identifiable information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Account data is stored on secure servers with encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and are never stored in plaintext. We implement industry-standard security measures including rate limiting, security headers, and input validation.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>UrbanAid uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Maps SDK:</strong> To display the map interface. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> For anonymized crash reporting. Subject to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Expo Updates:</strong> To deliver over-the-air app updates. No personal data is transmitted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Account data is retained as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time by contacting us. User-generated content (utility locations and reviews) may be retained in anonymized form to benefit the community.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <li>Revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
